# dicewar-game
 Simple dice game. This is my first application project in Python. In this simple game built with Kivy, two players throw their own dice subsequently. The game happens in rounds as each round comprises each player's turn. Player 1 rolls their die first, followed by Player 2. The objective of the game in this first version is to roll a number larger than that of the opponent's. Each player's victory is registered in the screen bellow the player's name. Draws are also registered. An upper display shows the number of rounds played.
